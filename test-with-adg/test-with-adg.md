# Test with ADG

Now we can run some testing with the ADG.

## Lab Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have already completed the following labs:

- Deploy Active Data Guard

## Step 1: Test transaction replication

1. From the primary side, create a test user in orclpdb, and grant privileges to the user. You need  to check if the pdb is open.

```
[oracle@primary ~]$ sqlplus / as sysdba

SQL> show pdbs

    CON_ID CON_NAME			  OPEN MODE  RESTRICTED

SQL> alter pluggable database all open;

Pluggable database altered.

SQL> alter session set container=orclpdb;

SQL> create user testuser identified by testuser;

User created.

SQL> grant connect,resource to testuser;

Grant succeeded.

SQL> alter user testuser quota unlimited on users;

User altered.

SQL> exit;
```

2. Connect with testuser, create test table and insert a test record.

```
[oracle@primary ~]$ sqlplus testuser/testuser@localhost:1521/orclpdb

SQL> create table test(a number,b varchar2(20));

Table created.
SQL> insert into test values(1,'line1');

1 row created.

SQL> commit;

Commit complete.

SQL>  
```

3. From the standby side, open the standby database as read only.

```
[oracle@standby ~]$ sqlplus / as sysdba

SQL> select open_mode,database_role from v$database;

OPEN_MODE	     DATABASE_ROLE

SQL> alter database open;

SQL> alter pluggable database orclpdb open;

Pluggable database altered.

[oracle@dbstby ~]$ 
```
If the `OPEN_MODE` is **READ ONLY**, you can run the following command in sqlplus as sysdba, then check the `open_mode` again, you can see the `OPEN_MODE` is **READ ONLY WITH APPLY** now.
```
SQL> alter database recover managed standby database cancel;

Database altered.

SQL> alter database recover managed standby database using current logfile disconnect;

Database altered.

SQL> select open_mode,database_role from v$database;

OPEN_MODE	     DATABASE_ROLE
-------------------- ----------------
READ ONLY WITH APPLY PHYSICAL STANDBY
```

4. From the standby side, connect as testuser to orclpdb. Check if the test table and record has replicated to the standby.

```
[oracle@standby ~]$ sqlplus testuser/testuser@localhost:1521/orclpdb

```



## Step 2: Test DML Redirection

Starting  with Oracle DB 19c, we can run DML operations on Active Data Guard standby databases. This enables you to occasionally execute DMLs on read-mostly applications on the standby database.

Automatic redirection of DML operations to the primary can be configured at the system level or the session level. The session level setting overrides the system level

1. From the standby side, connect to orclpdb as testuser. Test the DML before and after the DML Redirection is enabled.

```
SQL> insert into test values(2,'line2');
insert into test values(2,'line2')
            *
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-16000: database or pluggable database open for read-only access


SQL> ALTER SESSION ENABLE ADG_REDIRECT_DML;

Session altered.

SQL> insert into test values(2,'line2');

1 row created.

SQL> commit; 

Commit complete.

SQL> select * from test;

	 A B
---------- --------------------
	 2 line2
	 1 line1

SQL> exit
Disconnected from Oracle Database 19c EE Extreme Perf Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production

[oracle@standby ~]$ 
```

2. From the primary side, connect to orclpdb as **testuser**. Check the records in the test table.

```
SQL> select * from test;

	 A B
---------- --------------------
	 2 line2
	 1 line1

SQL> exit

```



## Step 3: Switchover to the Cloud 

At any time, you can manually execute a Data Guard switchover (planned event) or failover (unplanned event). Customers may also choose to automate Data Guard failover by configuring Fast-Start failover. Switchover and failover reverse the roles of the databases in a Data Guard configuration â€“ the standby database becomes primary and the original primary becomes the standby database. Refer to Oracle MAA Best Practices for additional information on Data Guard role transitions. 

Switchovers are always a planned event that guarantees no data is lost. To execute a switchover, perform the following in Data Guard Broker 

1. Connect DGMGRL from the primary side, validate the standby database to see if Ready For Switchover is Yes. 

```
[oracle@primary ~]$ dgmgrl sys/Ora_DB4U@orcl

Welcome to DGMGRL, type "help" for information.

  Ready for Switchover:  Yes
  Ready for Failover:    Yes (Primary Running)

2. Switch over to the standby database.

```
DGMGRL> switchover to orclstby

```

3. Check from the original primary side. You can see the previous primary side becomes the new standby side.

```
