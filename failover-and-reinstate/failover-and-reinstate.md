# Failover and Reinstate

## Introduction
A failover is an unplanned event that assumes the primary database is lost. The standby database is converted to a primary database immediately. A failover might result in some data loss when you use **Maximum Performance** protection mode. After a failover the old primary database must be reinstated as a physical standby which is made simpler with flashback database and Data Guard broker enabled. 

Estimated Lab Time: 30 minutes.

### Objectives
- Setup the current primary database flashback on.
- Failover.
- Reinstate the previous primary database.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have already completed the following labs:

- Deploy Active Data Guard
- Test with Active Data Guard

## **Step 1:** Setup the current primary database flashback on

In the previous lab, you have done the Data Guard switch over. Now, the current primary database is the **ORCLSTBY** and the current standby database is the **ORCL**.

1. From the current primary side. Check the flashback status of the current primary database

```
[oracle@standby ~]$ sqlplus / as sysdba

2. If the flashback is not enabled you need to setup database flashback on, otherwise you won't be able to reinstate the primary after the failover.

## **Step 2:** Failover

1. Connect with DGMGRL, validate the primary and standby database

```
[oracle@standby ~]$ dgmgrl sys/Ora_DB4U@orcl
DGMGRL for Linux: Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production on Wed Feb 5 05:41:24 2020

Welcome to DGMGRL, type "help" for information.
Connected to "ORCL"
Connected as SYSDBA.
DGMGRL> show configuration

Configuration - adgconfig

  Protection Mode: MaxPerformance
  Members:
  orclstby - Primary database
    orcl     - Physical standby database 

Fast-Start Failover:  Disabled

Configuration Status:
SUCCESS   (status updated 56 seconds ago)

DGMGRL> validate database orclstby

  Database Role:    Primary database

  Ready for Switchover:  Yes

  Flashback Database Status:
    orclstby:  Off

    orclstby:  NO             
    Validating static connect identifier for the primary database orclstby...
    The static connect identifier allows for a connection to database "orclstby".

DGMGRL> validate database orcl

  Database Role:     Physical standby database
  Primary Database:  orclstby

  Ready for Switchover:  Yes
  Ready for Failover:    Yes (Primary Running)

  Flashback Database Status:
    orclstby:  Off
    orcl    :  On

  Managed by Clusterware:
    orclstby:  NO             
    orcl    :  NO

    The static connect identifier allows for a connection to database "orclstby".

  Log Files Cleared:
    orclstby Standby Redo Log Files:  Cleared
    orcl Online Redo Log Files:       Not Cleared
    orcl Standby Redo Log Files:      Available

DGMGRL> 
```

2. Failover to current standby.

```
DGMGRL> failover to orcl
Performing failover NOW, please wait...
Failover succeeded, new primary is "orcl"
DGMGRL> show configuration

Configuration - adgconfig

  Protection Mode: MaxPerformance
  Members:
  orcl     - Primary database
    orclstby - Physical standby database (disabled)
      ORA-16661: the standby database needs to be reinstated

Fast-Start Failover:  Disabled

Configuration Status:
SUCCESS   (status updated 114 seconds ago)

DGMGRL> 
```

Now, the primary is the back to the **ORCL** database, and the standby database is disabled, which needs to be reinstated.

## **Step 3:** Reinstate the previous primary database

1. Connect  to the current standby database, shutdown the database and startup mount before reinstating. 

```
DGMGRL> <copy>connect sys/Ora_DB4U@orclstby</copy>
Connected to "ORCLSTBY"
Connected as SYSDBA.
DGMGRL> <copy>shutdown immediate</copy>
Database closed.
Database dismounted.
ORACLE instance shut down.
Connected to an idle instance.
DGMGRL> <copy>startup mount</copy>
Connected to "ORCLSTBY"
ORACLE instance started.
Database mounted.
DGMGRL>   
```

2. Connect to the new primary side, reinstate the standby database.

```
DGMGRL> <copy>connect sys/Ora_DB4U@orcl</copy>
Connected to "ORCL"
Connected as SYSDBA.
DGMGRL> reinstate database orclstby
Reinstating database "orclstby", please wait...
Reinstatement of database "orclstby" succeeded
DGMGRL> <copy>show configuration</copy>

Configuration - adgconfig

  Protection Mode: MaxPerformance
  Members:
  orcl        - Primary database
    orclstby - Physical standby database 

Fast-Start Failover:  Disabled

Configuration Status:
SUCCESS   (status updated 21 seconds ago)

DGMGRL>
```
If you encounter the Warning: ORA-16809: multiple warnings detected for the member or Warning: ORA-16854: apply lag could not be determined. Wait some time and show configuration again.

3. Check the status of the new standby database

```
[oracle@standby ~]$ sqlplus / as sysdba
